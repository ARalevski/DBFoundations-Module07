#SQL Functions

##Introduction
In Module07, I will be learning about the different types of SQL functions, including user-defined functions (UDFs), as well as scalar, inline, and multi-statement functions.

##User-Defined Function (UDF)
A user-defined function (UDF) in SQL allows you to create and customize your own functions. Scalar functions allow you to return a single value. Table-valued functions (TVF) returns a whole table instead of just one parameter. There are two types of TVFs: inline and multi-statement. Inline functions do not have a begin/end block, and the select statement is the output. Multi-statement functions can contain multiple statements, start with a begin/end block, and use the return operator.

##Summary
In summary, there are a variety of different functions available to create custom code in SQL. Whether you are returning tables or single values, or using one or many statements, SQL makes it easy to create easy-to-use custom functions for a variety of purposes.
